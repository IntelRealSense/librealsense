# Introduction

This demo shows implementation of 6 DoF pose estimation based on RGB only and known object.
The code is available from RobotAI site ([https://wwww.robotai.info](https://www.robotai.info/))

-   6D Pose estimation : estimates translation and rotation of knwon objects
-   Accuracy  : depends on the distance from the sensor

This code could be integrated in your robotics and video processing pipe line.

## Installation Windows/Ubuntu

1. Install Pose6D executable from RobotAI

## Usage

1. install Pose6D executable:
2. Connect to RealSense camera
3. Acquire dataset of the object you want to detect
4. Label the data using RobotAI labeling tool
5. Train AI model
6. Run Pose6D software to detect the object in real time

## Test

Start Pose6D server and connect to it.
