# rs-pointcloud-stitching

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to stitch together 2 devices into a single, wide FOV, virtual device.
`pointcloud-stitching` projects the 2 pointclouds on the same virtual device's image to create a stitched image which adhere to the pinhole camera model. This virtual device can then be loaded and viewed using realsense-viewer application. 

For a complete explanation and example of setting the inpput files and the calibration process see [pointcloud-stitching-demo.md](doc/pointcloud-stitching-demo.md)
