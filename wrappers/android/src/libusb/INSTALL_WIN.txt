Installation Instructions for Windows
*************************************

If you are compiling for MinGW or cygwin, please refer to the INSTALL file.

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio:
- Open the relevant solution file in /msvc:
  libusb.dsw for MSVC6, libusb_2005.sln for Visual Studio 2005 or 2008,
  libusb_2010.sln for Visual Studio 2010,
  libusb_2012.sln for Visual Studio 2012 or later,
  libusb_wince.sln for Windows CE support in Visual Studio 2005.
- If you want to debug the library, uncomment the ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING define
  in msvc\config.h
- Select your configuration and compile the project

Note that if you are using Visual Studio Express, you may have to install the
Windows SDK to be able to compile the 64 bit version of the library.

If you are using the freely available Windows DDK/WDK (Driver Development Kit)
- If you want to debug the library, uncomment the ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING define
  in msvc\config.h
- Open one of the relevant Free Build or Checked Build prompt for your target
  platform
- Navigate to the msvc\ directory where the ddk_build.cmd file is located, and
  run 'ddk_build'
- To produce a DLL rather than a static library, use: 'ddk_build DLL'
- To produce a static library that uses LIBCMT[d] instead of MSVCRT[d] (/MT[d]
  vs /MD[d] in Visual Studio) use: 'ddk_build /MT'

Note that using the Windows DDK, it is possible to compile both the 32 and 64
bit versions of the library.

If you are building for Windows CE then you will need the Windows CE Standard 5.00 SDK.

Destination directories
***********************

The 32 bit binaries compiled either from Visual Studio or the DDK are placed in
a Win32\ directory at the root of the library
The 64 bit binaries are placed in an x64\ directory
Windows CE binaries are placed in one of the following directories, depending
on the target processor: ARMV4I, MIPSII, MIPSII_FP, MIPSIV, MIPSIV_FP, SH4 or x86.


Troubleshooting
***************

If the compilation process complains about missing libraries, ensure that the
default library paths for your project points to the relevant directories.
If needed, these libraries can be obtained by installing either the latest
Windows SDK or the DDK (Links provided at the end of this file).

For Windows CE it is necessary to install the CE USB Kernel Wrapper driver for
libusb to function on a device.
