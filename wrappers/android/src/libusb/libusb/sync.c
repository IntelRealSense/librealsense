 * \param bRequest the request field for the setup packet
 * \param wValue the value field for the setup packet
 * \param wIndex the index field for the setup packet
 * \param data a suitably-sized data buffer for either input or output
 * (depending on direction bits within bmRequestType)
 * \param wLength the length field for the setup packet. The data buffer should

 * \returns LIBUSB_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM if the transfer size is larger than
 * the operating system and/or hardware can support
