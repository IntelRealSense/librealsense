# rs-fw-update Tool

## Goal
`rs-fw-update` tool is a console application for updating the depth cameras firmware.

## Prerequisites
In order to update a depth camera firmware, a signed image file is required.
The latest firmware for D400 cameras is available [here.](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28870/Latest-Firmware-for-Intel-RealSense-D400-Product-Family?product=128255)
The firmware is packed into zip file and contains a file with "bin" extension with the following naming convension: "Signed_Image_UVC_<firmware_version>.bin"

## Usage
After installing `librealsense` run ` rs-fw-update -l` to launch the tool and print a list of connected devices.
An example for output for a D415 camera is:

```
Connected devices:
1) [USB] Intel RealSense D435IF s/n 038322070306, update serial number: 039223050231, firmware version: 5.15.1
```

Then we will provid the serial number to identify the device together with the path to firmware file that we want to update ` rs-fw-update -s 038322070306 -f Signed_Image_UVC_5_15_1_0.bin`.
An example for the expected output is:

```
Search for device with serial number: 038322070306

Updating device FW:
[USB] Intel RealSense D435IF s/n 038322070306, update serial number: 039223050231, firmware version: 5.15.1

Firmware update started. Please don't disconnect device!

Firmware update progress: 100[%]

Firmware update done

Waiting for device to reconnect...

Device 038322070306 successfully updated to FW: 5.15.1
```

In case only one camera is connected you can simply run ` rs-fw-update -f Signed_Image_UVC_5_15_1_0.bin`.

A camera/s might be in a recovery state, in such case listing the devices will output the following:

```
Connected devices:
1) [0ADB] Intel RealSense D4XX Recovery, update serial number: 039223050231, firmware version: 5.16.0.1
```

In such case we can use the recovery flag and run ` rs-fw-update -r -f Signed_Image_UVC_5_15_1_0.bin`
An example for the expected output is:

```
Update to FW: Signed_Image_UVC_5_15_1_0.bin

Recovering device:
[0ADB] Intel RealSense D4XX Recovery, update serial number: 039223050231, firmware version: 5.16.0.1

Firmware update started. Please don't disconnect device!

Firmware update progress: 100[%]

Firmware update done
Waiting for new device...

Recovery done

```
