# rs-fw-logger Tool

## Goal
`rs-fw-logger` tool is a console application for collecting internal camera logs.
If you are suspecting that you have an issue that is related to the cameraâ€™s firmware, please use this tool and provide the output together with the FW version number when you are creating an issue.
In order to run this, ensure that your camera is streaming. This can be done using the [realsense-viewer](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/tools/realsense-viewer) or [rs-capture Sample](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/examples/capture)

## Command Line Parameters
|Flag   |Description   |Default|
|---|---|---|
|`-l <xml-path>`|xml file ful path, used to parse the logs||
|`-f`|collect flash logs instead of firmware logs||

## Usage
After installing `librealsense` run `rs-fw-logger` to launch the tool.
