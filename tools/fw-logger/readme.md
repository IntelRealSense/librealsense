# rs-fw-logger Tool

## Goal
`rs-fw-logger` tool is a console application for collecting internal camera logs.

In order to run this, ensure that your camera is streaming. This can be done using the [realsense-viewer](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/tools/realsense-viewer) or [rs-capture Sample](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/development/examples/capture)
