# rs-imu-calibration Tool:

## Goal
The tool is intended to calibrate the IMU built in D435i cameras

## Description
D435i cameras arrive from the factory without IMU calibration. Hence the values may be slightly off.
In order to improve accuracy, a calibration procedure should be done.
The rs-imu-calibration tool walks you through the calibration steps and saves the calibration coefficients to the EEPROM, to be applied automatically by the driver.

## Command Line Parameters

|Flag   |Description   |Default|

|`-i <accel_filename> [gyro_filename]`| Load previously saved results to EEPROM| |
|`-s serial_no`| calibrate device with given serial_no| calibrate first found device|
|`-g `|show graph of data before and after calibration| ||

# Calibration Procedure:
Running:

`python rs-imu-calibration.py`

The script runs you through the 6 main orientations of the camera.
For each direction there are the following steps:
*	**Rotation:**<br>
  *	The script prints the following line, describing how to orient the camera:<br>
`Align to direction:  [ 0. -1.  0.]   Upright facing out`<br>
  *	Then it prints the status (rotate) and the difference from the desired orientation:<br>
  `Status.rotate:           [ 1.0157 -0.1037  0.9945]:                 [False False False]`<br>
  *	You have to bring the numbers to [0,0,0] and then you are in the right direction and the script moves on to the next status.<br><br>

*	**Wait to Stablize:**<br>
  *	The script waits for you to be stable for 3 seconds. Meanwhile there is a countdown message:<br>
  `Status.wait_to_stable: 2.8 (secs)`<br>
  *	When waited for 3 seconds, the script begin to <b>collect data:<br><br>

*	**Collecting data:**<br>
  *	Status line is a line of dots. When reaching 20 dots, enough data is collected and script carries on to next orientation.<br>
  *	If camera is no longer in the precise orientation, data is not collected.
  *	If camera is moved too much, going back to <b>Rotation status.

When done all 6 orientations, the following message appears, suggesting you to save the raw data gathered:<br>
`Would you like to save the raw data? Enter footer for saving files (accel_<footer>.txt and gyro_<footer>.txt)`<br>
`Enter nothing to not save raw data to disk. >`<br>

Either press “Enter” not to save or an ending (like 2 or <serial_no>_1) to save the accel.txt, gyro.txt.<br>

The files can be loaded using the “-i” option.

Then the script will ask to save the data to the Device.<br>
Choose Y (or any other combination with Y or y in it) to save.

That’s it. At the end a confirmation message appears:<br>
`SUCCESS: saved calibration to camera.`

**NOTICE:**<br>
CTRL-C isn’t working so press CTRL-Z and then `kill -9 %1` if you want to terminate in the middle…

**Appendix A:**<br>
I found it a little challenging to hold the camera in the precise 90 degrees angle needed.
Therefor I used my original camera's box as a camera holder.
I cut a little piece so the cord may come out, and that's it:<br>
