/**
\mainpage libuvc: a cross-platform library for USB video devices

\b libuvc is a library that supports enumeration, control and streaming
for USB Video Class (UVC) devices, such as consumer webcams.

\section features Features
\li UVC device \ref device "discovery and management" API
\li \ref streaming "Video streaming" (device to host) with asynchronous/callback and synchronous/polling modes
\li Read/write access to standard \ref ctrl "device settings"
\li \ref frame "Conversion" between various formats: RGB, YUV, JPEG, etc.
\li Tested on Mac and Linux, portable to Windows and some BSDs

\section roadmap Roadmap
\li Bulk-mode image capture
\li One-shot image capture
\li Improved support for standard settings
\li Support for "extended" (vendor-defined) settings

\section misc Misc.
\p The source code can be found at https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc. To build
the library, install <a href="http://libusb.org/">libusb</a> 1.0+ and run:

\code
$ git clone https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc.git
$ cd libuvc
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make && make install
\endcode

\section Example
In this example, libuvc is used to acquire images in a 30 fps, 640x480
YUV stream from a UVC device such as a standard webcam.
