# Jetson TX2 Installation

**NOTE: Intel does not officially support the Jetson line of devices. Furthermore, there are several [knownÂ issues](../../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20jetson) with running librealsense on jetson.**<br/><br/>
To install librealsense on the Jetson TX2 Developer Kit, Follow the [regular instructions](installation.md) for Ubuntu 16.04.

QtCreator won't work out of the box on the Jetson. JetsonHacks has posted a [helpful tutorial](http://www.jetsonhacks.com/2017/01/31/install-qt-creator-nvidia-jetson-tx1/) explaining how to properly configure it.
