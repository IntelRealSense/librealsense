# Linux Distribution

#### Using pre-build packages
**Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0** provides installation packages in [`dpkg`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg) format for Ubuntu 16/18 [LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).    
The Realsense [DKMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support) kernel drivers package (`librealsense2-dkms`) supports Ubuntu LTS kernels 4.4, 4.10, 4.13 and 4.15. Please refer to [Ubuntu Kernel Release Schedule](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Support) for further details.

#### Configuring and building from the source code
While we strongly recommend to use DKMS package whenever possible, there are certain cases where installing and patching the system manually is necessary:
 - Using SDK with linux kernel **version 4.16+**
 - Integration of user-specific patches/modules with `librealsense` SDK.
 - Adjusting the patches for alternative kernels/distributions.

The steps are described in [Linux manual installation guide](./installation.md)


## Installing the packages:
- Register the server's public key:  
`sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE || sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE`  
In case the public key still cannot be retrieved, check and specify proxy settings: `export http_proxy="http://<proxy>:<port>"`  
, and rerun the command. See additional methods in the following [link](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/361213/unable-to-add-gpg-key-with-apt-key-behind-a-proxy).  

- Add the server to the list of repositories:  
  Ubuntu 16 LTS:  
`sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://realsense-hw-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Debian/apt-repo xenial main" -u`  
  Ubuntu 18 LTS:  
`sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://realsense-hw-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Debian/apt-repo bionic main" -u`

- Install the libraries (see section below if upgrading packages):  
  `sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dkms`  
  `sudo apt-get install librealsense2-utils`  
  The above two lines will deploy librealsense2 udev rules, build and activate kernel modules, runtime library and executable demos and tools.  

- Optionally install the developer and debug packages:  
  `sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dev`  
  `sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dbg`  
  With `dev` package installed, you can compile an application with **librealsense** using `g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp -lrealsense2` or an IDE of your choice.

Reconnect the Intel RealSense depth camera and run: `realsense-viewer` to verify the installation.

Verify that the kernel is updated :    
`modinfo uvcvideo | grep "version:"` should include `realsense` string

## Upgrading the Packages:
Refresh the local packages cache by invoking:  
  `sudo apt-get update`  

Upgrade all the installed packages, including `librealsense` with:  
  `sudo apt-get upgrade`

To upgrade selected packages only a more granular approach can be applied:  
  `sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install <package1 package2 ...>`  
  E.g:   
  `sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install  librealsense2-utils librealsense2-dkms`  

## Uninstalling the Packages:
**Important** Removing Debian package is allowed only when no other installed packages directly refer to it. For example removing `librealsense2-udev-rules` requires `librealsense2` to be removed first.

Remove a single package with:   
  `sudo apt-get purge <package-name>`  

Remove all RealSense™ SDK-related packages with:   
  `dpkg -l | grep "realsense" | cut -d " " -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --purge`
