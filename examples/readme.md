# Sample Code for Intel® RealSense™ Depth cameras
**Code Examples to start prototyping quickly:** These simple examples demonstrate how to easily use the SDK to include code snippets that access the camera into your applications.  

For mode advanced usages you might also want to review the list of [Tools](../tools) we provide. 

For a detailed explanations and API documentation see our [Documentation](../doc) section 
 
## List of Samples:

1. [Capture](./capture) - Show how to syncronize and render multiple streams: left & right imagers, depth and RGB streams. 
2. [Save To Disk](./save-to-disk) - Demonstrate how to render and save video streams on headless systems without graphical user interface (GUI). 
3. [Multicam](./multicam) - Present multiple cameras depth streams simultaneously, in separate windows.
4. [Pointcloud](./pointcloud) - Showcase Projection API while generating and rendering 3D pointcloud. 
5. [Streams Alignment](./align) - Show a simple method for dynamic background removal from video. 
6. Measure - Lets the user measure the dimentions of 3D objects in a picture.
