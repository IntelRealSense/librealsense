# Objective:
#
# Verify that pause & resume did not mess up the recorded timestamps and the sleep time between each 2 frames is
# reasonable. We had a BUG with calculating the sleep time between each 2 frames when the pause action occurred
# before the recording base time was set (first frame arrival time), causing the recorded bag file "capture
# time" to go up and down, and therefore huge sleep times. See [DSO-14342]
# 
# Here we test multiple flows on pause & resume actions and verify that the whole file will be be played until a
# stop event (EOF) within a reasonable time.
