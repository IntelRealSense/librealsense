# Frame-rate limits when depth/IR and color stream together on a dual-color (2C) device.
#
# Both run off the same imagers, so together they cap at 45 FPS and must share one frame rate:
# the enumerated 60/90 FPS profiles, and any rate mismatch, stream no frames at all. The SDK
# rejects those combinations at sensor open with a user-friendly error, surfaced as a
# RuntimeError in Python. Resolutions may differ freely and are not restricted.
#
# The test adapts to the device: each case skips when the device does not publish the profiles
# it needs, rather than gating on firmware versions.
