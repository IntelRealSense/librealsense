"""
This module is for formatting and writing unit-tests in python. The general format is as follows
1. Use start() to start a test and give it, as an argument, the name of the test
2. Use whatever check functions are relevant to test the run
3. Use finish() to signal the end of the test
4. Repeat stages 1-3 as the number of tests you want to run in the file
5. Use print_results_and_exit() to print the number of tests and assertions that passed/failed in the correct format
   before exiting with 0 if all tests passed or with 1 if there was a failed test

In addition you may want to use the 'info' functions in this module to add more detailed
messages in case of a failed check
