TCLAP - Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

This is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner.  It doesn't conform exactly
to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close.  See
docs/manual.html for descriptions of how things work or look at the
simple examples in the examples dir.
