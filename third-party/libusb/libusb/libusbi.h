	 * populated). This can now be added to the discovered devices list
	 * using discovered_devs_append(). Note that discovered_devs_append()
	 * may reallocate the list, returning a new location for it, and also
	 * note that reallocation can fail. Your backend should handle these
	 * error conditions appropriately.
	 *
	 * This function should not generate any bus I/O and should not block.
	 * If I/O is required (e.g. reading the active configuration value), it is
	 * OK to ignore these suggestions :)
	 *
	 * This function is executed when the user wishes to retrieve a list
	 * of USB devices connected to the system.
